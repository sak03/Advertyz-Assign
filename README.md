TODO: This is a simple assignment where main task is to fetch the data through API call. The Fetch data is seeen in the console of web browser.
For this assignment I made a simple landing page containing navbar, crusol, user card and footer.
In the navbar there is a button called "get users" through which the data can fetch using API call. In the same button I also made a loader while data is fetching. And also fetch local data through the card's button called "See more details".
 The fetched data can be seen in console.
## Instruction for Usage
TODO: just open the index.html file in any web browser,
 open console in the web browser
click on "get users" button and
 click on "see more details"
see the fetch data in console
### Credits
